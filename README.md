# MJHP_analysis
The Mott-Jones Hamilton Population analysis. A program for analyzing the Mott-Jones effect in intermetallic compounds.

## Installation
Provided you have an SSH key to clone the repo, run these commands:
```
git clone git@github.com:lcgarman/MJHP_analysis.git
cd MJHP_analysis/src
make -f makefile-mjhpHKL
make -f makefile-mjhp2theta
make -f makefile-prep2theta
```
This will clone the repo into your current directory, change to the necessary directory, and run the makefiles to compile the necessary executables. You may copy the binaries into any directory in your $PATH (/usr/local/bin, for instance). 

## Dependencies

### Compilation

The GNU Scientific Libary, libxc, and fftw3 are required for compiling the MJHP_analysis.

### Running Calculation

The MJHP_analysis requires outputs from abinit version 7.10.5. This method requires HGH (Hartwigsen-Goedecker-Hutter) norm-conserving pseudopotentials and LDA exchange-correlation functionals. The MJHP_analysis expects the necessary binary abinit output files to be named: FILENAME_o_XXX, where XXX refers to the different file types. 

I recommend working in two separate directories for the MJHP_analysis, let’s call these directories:

  2theta
  
  HKL

Copy from the single-point energy calculation into the 2theta directory: the abinit FILENAME.in, FILENAME.files, and FILENAME_i_DEN (the output density from to be used as the starting ground state density).

Copy from the single-point energy calculation into the HKL directory: the abinit FILENAME.out, FILENAME_o_POT, and FILENAME_o_WFK files.

One additional input file is required in both of these directories: FILENAME.mjin. Start by making this file in the 2theta directory with the following format:
```
IN_FILENAME

OUT_COMPOUND

vec #

xY
```
The first line, IN_FILENAME, should be the file string corresponding to your abinit output files. The OUT_COMPOUND is what you would like the the output files from the MJHP_analysis program to be called. The third line expects a string followed by a number (double or integer) that corresponds to the number of valence electrons in the unit cell of your compound. The fourth line, xY, should be two letters where the first (x) corresponds to the crystal family and the second to the centering type (Y). This line is case sensitive, so x should be lowercase and Y uppercase, identical to the letters of a Pearson symbol. 

Once the FILENAME.mjin file and the necessary abinit files are within the 2theta directory run the executable:
```
prepare_mjhp2theta FILENAME.mjin
```
This will find the high symmetry k-points of interest and copy them into your abinit FILENAME.in file, as well as set up an OUT_COMPOUND.rflc file necessary for the MJHP_analysis to follow. Run the non-self consistent abinit calculation with this modified FILENAME.in file. Following the completion of this job, in the same directory run the following executable to perform the first MJHP_analysis:
```
mjhp2theta_analyze  FILENAME.mjin >& FILENAME_mjhp2theta.log
```
The ">& FILENAME_mjhpHKL.log" is optional and will print the command line output to that log file. This executable will generate the OUT_FILENAME_2theta.mjout file that can be plotted using the matlab program:
```
plot_MJHP_2theta('OUT_COMPOUND_2theta.mjout')
```
This completes the first MJHP analysis. 


Now, navigate to the HKL directory, and copy over the FILENAME.mjin file from the 2theta directory. This file now requires a few additional lines as follows:
```
IN_FILENAME

OUT_COMPOUND

vec #

xY

no_HKL #

HKL

h1 k1 l1

h2 k2 l2

hn kn ln
```
The first four lines should not change from the 2theta to HKL calculations. The fifth line, should be a string, followed by an integer of how many datasets you want to run. The sixth line should be a string “HKL”. Following this line should be a list of the conventional HKL indices you are interested in analyzing. The number of lines following HKL on the sixth line should correspond to the integer following the no_HKL on the fifth line. Following this set up, run the executable:
```
mjhpHKL_analyze FILENAME.mjin >& FILENAME_mjhpHKL.log
```
Again, the ">& FILENAME_mjhpHKL.log" is optional and will print the command line output to the log file. This executable will generate one OUT_COMPOUND_h1k1l1.mjout (h1k1l1 corresponding to the conventional indices for the reciprocal lattice vectors of interest) file for each dataset. The results from this analysis may be plotted using the matlab program:
```
plot_MJHP_HKL('OUT_COMPOUND_h1k1l1.mjout', minY, maxY)
```
The  minY and maxY values correspond to the min and max energy range you want to view. 

This completes the MJHP_analysis.
